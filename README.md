A virtual assistant that helps to predict the price of property, properly.

## Introduction
There is only one word to describe the *property market* in Malaysia : Volatile.

The case is especially true as the COVID-19 global pandemic adds oil to fire, with analysts and stakeholders describing the *property market* being full of uncertainties and ambiguities, causing decision making to be harder than ever before.

Even so, as Malaysia slowly opens up, some decisions have to be made such as :
- If I am a **Property Developer**, and I want to build bungalows, what would be a good price to **SELL**?
- If I am a **Property Investor**, and I want to purchase houses to be rented out or do AirBnB, what would be a good entry point to **BUY**?
- If I am a **Student**, and I want to find a place near my university to stay, what would be a good price to **RENT**?

These are good questions without good answers, but my project here will provide a solution to the concerns above. View the video below to learn more!
